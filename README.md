## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip package manager

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd diabitesss/myenv
```

2. **Create virtual environment** (recommended)
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On macOS/Linux
# or
venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
```

3. **Install required packages**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Required packages:
```
streamlit
pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
pickle-mixin
```

4. **Verify model files exist**
```bash
ls *.pkl
# Should show: randomforest.pkl, scaler.pkl
```

### Model files & storage

The trained model (`randomforest.pkl`) is a large binary (≈80MB). Storing large binaries directly in the git history can bloat the repository and slow clones. Choose one of the options below:

- Option A (recommended): Host the model outside the repo (GitHub Release, cloud storage) and download it when needed:

```bash
# example: download to project root
curl -L -o randomforest.pkl "<model-download-url>"
curl -L -o scaler.pkl "<scaler-download-url>"
```

- Option B: Use Git Large File Storage (Git LFS) to keep model files in the repo without bloating history:

```bash
# macOS example
brew install git-lfs
git lfs install
git lfs track "*.pkl"
git add .gitattributes
git rm --cached randomforest.pkl scaler.pkl
git add randomforest.pkl scaler.pkl
git commit -m "Move model files to Git LFS"
git push origin main
```

Option A is the safest if you want to avoid rewriting repo history. Option B is convenient when you want the model to remain part of the repo but tracked via LFS.
## 💻 Usage

### Running the Web Application

1. **Start the Streamlit app**
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. **Access the application**
- Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:8501`
- The app will automatically open in your default browser

3. **Make a prediction**
   - Enter patient clinical measurements
   - Provide medical history and lifestyle information
   - Click "Predict" button
   - View the predicted diabetes type with confidence score

## 🧠 Model Details

### Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

**Hyperparameters**:
- `n_estimators`: 100 (number of trees)
- `random_state`: 42 (for reproducibility)
- Default scikit-learn settings for other parameters

### Training Process:

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Label encoding for categorical features
   - StandardScaler for numerical features normalization

2. **Train-Test Split**
   - 80% training data
   - 20% test data
   - Random state: 42

3. **Model Training**
   - Random Forest with 100 decision trees
   - Multi-class classification
   - Cross-validation for robustness

### Feature Importance:
The model uses all 17 features with varying importance:
- Blood Glucose Levels
- Age
- BMI
- Genetic Markers
- Family History
- (and 12 more features)

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Overfitting**: Model shows 100% training accuracy vs 85% test accuracy (15% gap)
2. **Class Imbalance**: Some diabetes types may have fewer samples
3. **Feature Encoding**: Manual encoding required for categorical features
4. **Medical Disclaimer**: This is a prediction tool for educational purposes only
5. **Large model files**: `randomforest.pkl` is ~80MB — consider hosting the file externally or using Git LFS. See the "Model files & storage" section for details.

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- [ ] Implement feature selection to reduce overfitting
- [ ] Add hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)
- [ ] Include feature importance visualization
- [ ] Add more detailed medical recommendations
- [ ] Implement model versioning
- [ ] Add data validation and error handling
- [ ] Create API endpoints for integration
- [ ] Add patient history tracking
- [ ] Implement explainable AI (SHAP values)

## 📝 How to Retrain the Model

1. Open `randomforest.ipynb` in Jupyter
2. Run all cells sequentially
3. Model will be saved automatically to `randomforest.pkl` and `scaler.pkl`
4. Restart the Streamlit app to use the new model
